    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, colloquially known as the G-Wagon (as an abbreviation of Geländewagen) is a four-wheel drive automobile manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Austria and sold by Mercedes-Benz. Originally developed as a military off-roader, later more luxurious models were added to the line. In certain markets, it was sold under the Puch name as Puch G until 2000.The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction. It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few passenger car vehicles to have such a feature.Despite the introduction of an intended replacement, the unibody SUV Mercedes-Benz GL-Class in 2006, the G-Class is still in production and is one of the longest-produced vehicles in Daimler's history, with a span of 44 years. Only the Unimog surpasses it. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz introduced the second-generation W463 with heavily revised chassis, powertrain, body, and interior. In 2023, Mercedes-Benz announced plans to launch a smaller version of the G-Class, named "little G"—though no definitive date was given for the launch.The 400,000th unit was built on 4 December 2020.The success of second-generation W463 led to the 500,000th unit milestone three years later on April 2023. The 500,000th model was a special one-off model with agave green paintwork, black front end, and amber turn signal indicators in tribute to the iconic 1979 press release photo of jumping W460 240 GD.</p>
